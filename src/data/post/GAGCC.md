The High-Level Forum on Generative AI Governance and Cultural Co-Creation convenes global thought leaders, policymakers, researchers, and industry innovators to explore how artificial intelligence can be governed responsibly while advancing cultural innovation and shared human values.

Hosted by the Media Intelligence Research Center at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), this signature event provides a premier platform for dialogue on the policy frameworks, regulatory approaches, and cultural paradigms shaping the future of generative AI. The program features visionary keynotes, innovation forums, and fireside dialogues that span critical themes—from digital policy and governance to AI’s transformative role in art, culture, and education. Distinguished keynote speakers include the Secretary for Justice, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, the Deputy Director of Intellectual Property, and the Chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, alongside leading academics, industry experts, and cultural leaders. The forum also features international perspectives on AI ethics and responsible innovation contributed by prominent global authorities in AI and digital policy.

Bringing together government leaders, scholars, innovators, and cultural institution directors, the forum will foster forward-looking discussions on trust, accountability, and cultural sustainability in the AI era—charting pathways toward AI systems that not only serve the public good but also preserve and celebrate the world’s cultural diversity.
